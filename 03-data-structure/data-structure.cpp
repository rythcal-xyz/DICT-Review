// what is Data? 

// Data are just a collection of facts, quantities, characters, symbols and figures, 
// or can say data are values or a set of values that are in a particular format 
// which maay be stored and transmitted by a computer.

// In computer terms, a data structure is a specific way to store and orgranize data 
// in a computer's memory so that these data can be used efficiently later. 
// Data may be arranged in many differnet ways/, such as the logical or mathematical model 
// for a particular organization of data is termed as a data structure.

// Example of it is an Array.


// memberID  |  fullName                 |   gender    |      dob         |
//-----------|---------------------------|-------------|------------------|  
// 31321     |  Jeferson G. Mabulay      |   Male      |      3/12/2000   |
// 31322     |  Shein Rose V. Montilla   |  Female     |      2/15/2004   |
// 31323     |  Limuel A. Jabon          |   Male      |      4/23/2002   |

// The variety of a specific data model depends on the two factors:

// First
// it must be loaded enough in structure to reflect the a
// ctual relationships of the data with the real-world objects.

// Example: 
// Data of the student, eg. the enrolled student, 
// it suppose to save the data to database.
// and retrieving it using the student id.


// Second 
// the formation should be simple enough so that anyone can effieciently 
// process the data each time it is necessary
// It should be a friendly-use or it can be easily manipulate to the db.

// Example: 
// The student was graduated.
// incorrect inputs and can be delete or update the data.


// Categories of Data Structure

// The data structure can be subdivided into major types:

// Linear Data Structure 

// Data Structure where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly where the elements are attached to its previous and next adjacent in what is called linear data structure.
// In linear data structure, single level is involved. Therefore, we can tranverse all the elements in single run 


// Non-Linear Data Structure
